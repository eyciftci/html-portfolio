<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Emir Yigit Ciftci â€” a computer science student at the University of Houston with a passion for technology, creativity, and community. 
  <br />I'm originally from Istanbul, Turkey, and I've been living in Houston for the past few years. 
  <br />Outside of academics, I love playing basketball, exploring entrepreneurial ideas, and connecting with others who are driven to grow and create. 
  <br />Whether it's coding a new project or building meaningful relationships, I'm always excited about learning and making an impact.
